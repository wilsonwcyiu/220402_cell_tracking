todo:

when redo track from former frame touchs start_frame of new cell in later frame, the new cell should be discarded

start frame of new cells

true recurssive behavior may help with the infinite loop pattern

check new cells before redo (redo cell may not be new cells anymore)

after doing the partial route feature, it is found that an collision scenario could still happen in the previous layer of the original collision location
(e.g. collision at frame 100 Cell_1 kicks away Cell_2, when Cell_1 re-route from frame 100, the final route in later part will be different that can affect the former route)
In short, re-route from frame 100 does not mean the route before frame 100 is final confirmed.

new cells in later layers has higher values because they have less multiplications. Example: cell start at frame 2 to 3 and frame 1 to 3. 0.9 x 0.9 > 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9
when threshold is very high (e.g. 0.95), it causes a lot of redo and make it almost impossible to finish
cell dependency feature to fasten redo process

fix a bug where i loop occupied cell list and assigned highest value whenever the latest cell is not higher than threshold (node should be invalid at once whenever one occupied cell has higher value)

lasts layer is not check with threshold, thus it can trigger infinite loop??
fix an issue in one_layer strategy that route with zero probability is being selected (in one of the layers is being selected)
fix an issue where last layer has no valid cells due to all node being occupied. (viterbi does not check last layer)
fix an issue where the new cell occurs in frame_num > 1 has no connection probability for route strategy process

enhance cut feature to allow cutting during or after routing process
enhance profit_matrix_list to profit_matrix_dict with frame_num as key
enhance start_index_list to start_index_list_dict with frame_num as key
enhance start_value_list to start_value_list_dict with frame_num as key
enhance cell_track dict key from incremental cell_idx to CellId(start_frame_num, node_idx)
merge initial program flow (from frame 1) and new program flow (from frame 2 to last_frame - 1)


??add first frame connection to start_list_index, start_list_value
